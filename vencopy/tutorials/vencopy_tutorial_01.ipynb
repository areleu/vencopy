This is carried out through a parsing interface to the original database. In the parsing interface to the data set, three main operations are carried out: the read-in of the travel survey trip data, stored in .dta or .csv files, filtering and cleaning of the original raw data set and a set of variable replacement operations to allow the composition of travel diaries in a following step (in the DiaryBuilder class).\n",
