class GridModeller:
    def __init__(self, configs: dict, activities):
        """
        The charging infrastructure allocation makes use of a basic charging
        infrastructure model, which infers the availability of charging stations
        from parking purposes (e.g. home or shopping). These again are inferred
        from the purposes of previously carried out trips. There are two mapping
        approaches of parking categories to charging station rated power that
        can be selected in the gridmodellers section of the user-config, in the
        option grid_model: Simple and probability-based. In the simple model,
        charging availability is allocated based on a binary TRUE/FALSE mapping
        to a respective parking activity purpose in the venco.py user-config.
        Thus, scenarios describing different charging availabilities, e.g. at
        home or at home and at work etc. can be distinguished. Charging is then
        assumed to be available with a single given rated power (e.g. 11 kW) for
        all park activities. The second model “probability”, refines the simple
        model in two regards: Firstly, multiple rated powers can be given per
        parking purpose, e.g. home charging can be available through
        single-phase, 16 A (3.7 kW), triple-phase, 16 A (11 kW) or triple-phase,
        32 A (22 kW) chargers. Secondly, top-down probabilities can be given to
        each rated power for each parking activity, e.g. there is a 20%
        probability of home chargers to be triple-phase, 16 A chargers. Here,
        the probability of no charging at home has to be taken into account. We
        have to be transparent that despite the methodological refinement of
        this second approach, data justifying the specific values of this
        approach is scarce and values are mostly future scenarios (relevant
        possibilities). At the end of the application of the GridModeller, an
        additional column “rated_power” is added to the activities data and
        filled for each parking activity.
