Introduction
===================================


Future electric vehicle fleets pose both challenges and opportunities for power
systems. While increased power demand from transport electrification
necessitates expansion of power supply, vehicle batteries can to a certain
degree shift their charging load to times of high availability of power. The
model-adequate description of power demand from future plug-in electric vehicle
fleets is a pre-requisite for modelling sector-coupled energy systems and
drawing respective policy-relevant conclusions. Vehicle Energy Consumption in
Python (venco.py) is a tool that provides boundary conditions for load shifting
and vehicle-to-grid potentials based on transport demand data and
techno-economic assumptions. It has so far been applied to the German travel
survey (Mobilität in Deutschland) on a national scale to derive hourly
load-shifting constraining profiles for the energy system optimization model
REMix.
