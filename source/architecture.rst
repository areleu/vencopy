Architecture documentation
===================================


General framework and degree of object-orientation
---------------------------------------------------

VencoPy was specifically designed to not strictly follow object-oriented programming. E.g., so far there is no class SOCProfiles and respective instances. This was a design choice early on in the design phase and is rooted in the tools orientation on simplicity and easy accessibility. VencoPy's structure is very simple: There is a main script, calling functions defined in various libraries (inputLib, processingLib etc.) that in turn access the config and input data. After the data read-in, all functions build on the output of preceding function calls and every calculation can be transparently read in the main script. Explicit prioritization of values are listed and described below.

     - Description
   * - 1. Learnability
     - The highest priority of VencoPy is to provide a straight-forward easy-to-apply tool to estimate electric vehicle fleets' load shifting potential. 
   * - 2. Readibility
     - Future developments should not impair the linear process structure of the main venco script file. Where a solution significantly contributes to the learnability (e.g. an additional library), this may motivate a deviation from this principle 
   * - 3. Reproducibility
     - Reproducibility is achieved by transparent versioning of the VencoPy releases as well as its well-defined input definition.
   * - 4. Reliability
     - Reliability is tested on various machines before release. However, in its alpha-version no special error catching routines are implemented.
   * - 5.Â Performance
     - Performance is not a high priority, since runtimes are quite quick. However, basic coding principles are applied to not unnecessarily overload the code or methods in the code.

     - Alpha release in Q3 2020, Beta release in Q1 2021
   * - Open source ready
     - Features, dependencies and components which are contraindicative or at odds with an open source publication should not be used
   * - Development tools
     - Source code and all artefacts are located in the DLR GITLAB repository for VencoPy including the software documentation. For development, the PyCharm community edition IDE and gitbash are used. For graphical depictions of software components and similar documentation draw.io is used.
